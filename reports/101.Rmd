Load in the packages we will use to explore the data set.

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)

```

Load in the training data and inspect it.

```{r}
training <- here::here("data", "train.csv")  %>%
            read.csv(na.strings = c("NA","NaN", " ", ""))

```

How many missing values do we have in each column?

```{r}

apply(training, 2, function(col) sum(is.na(col)))

```
Age and cabin variables are missing for a lot of rows (19% and 77%
respectively) while Embarked is missing for only 2 passengers.

## Factors influencing the rate of survival

Let us fix the classes of the factors first.

```{r}

 
training$Survived %<>% factor
training$Pclass %<>% factor
training$Sex %<>% factor
training$Age %<>% as.numeric
training$Fare %<>% as.numeric
```

For the moment, I  will ignore the variables Name and Ticket as it is
reasonable to assume that they will not be useful in predicting the survival.

```{r}
training_relevant <- select(training, -c(Name, Ticket))
training_tall <- tidyr::gather(training_relevant,
                               key = variable,
                               value = "value", -c(PassengerId, Survived),
                               factor_key = T)

ggplot(training_tall, aes(Survived)) + geom_bar(position = 'dodge') + facet_wrap(~variable)

```

That's too coarse a view to tell me anything useful. I'll look at each
variable separately to tease out the effect.

## Passenger ticket class vs Survived 

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(training_relevant, aes(Survived, fill = Pclass)) +
    geom_bar(position = 'dodge') + theme_tufte()

```
As expected, a lot more passengers with 3rd class tickets died. The
effect on survival however is not so clear (the irony!).

## Passenger sex  vs Survived 

```{r}
ggplot(training_relevant, aes(Survived, fill = Sex)) +
    geom_bar(position = 'dodge') + theme_tufte()
```

A lot more males died, perhaps due to the policy of women and children
first.

## Passenger age vs Survived 
```{r}
survived <- filter(training_relevant,  Survived == 1)
died <- filter(training_relevant, Survived == 0)

ggplot(survived, aes(Age, fill = Survived)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 10, col = "grey") + theme_tufte() +
    geom_histogram(data = died,
                   aes(x = Age, y = -..count.., fill = Survived),
                   bins = 10, col = "grey") 
 



```

The graph suggests that the survivors and victims have similar
frequency distribution except for the fat left tail in survivors.


## Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic vs Survived 	

```{r}

ggplot() +
    geom_bar(data = survived, aes(x = SibSp, y = ..count.., fill = Survived)) +
    geom_bar(data = died, aes(x = SibSp, y = -..count.., fill = Survived)) +
    theme_tufte()

```
Again, the graph suggests that this variable may not have a lot of
predictive power.

## Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic vs Survived 	

```{r}

ggplot() +
    geom_bar(data = survived, aes(x = Parch, y = ..count.., fill = Survived)) +
    geom_bar(data = died, aes(x = Parch, y = -..count.., fill = Survived)) +
    theme_tufte()

```

## Fare vs Survived

The fare a passenger paid serves as a proxy of their ticket
class. Therefore one would expect that this variable would influence
the survived status in a similar way.

```{r}

ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(data = training_relevant,
                   aes(x = Fare, y = ..count.., fill = Survived),
                   bins = 10, col = "grey", position = 'dodge') + theme_tufte() 

```

Passengers who paid lower fare appear to be over-represented in the
set of victims. 

```{r}

ggplot(training_relevant, aes(Pclass, Fare, color = Survived)) +
    geom_boxplot() + theme_tufte()

```

So it appears that a passenger traveling on a 3rd class ticket was as
likely to live as to die while someone traveling on a 1st class ticket
had a better chance of surviving.

## Port of Embarkation vs Survived

```{r}

ggplot() +
    geom_bar(data = training_relevant,
             aes(x = Embarked, y = ..count.., fill = Survived), position = 'dodge') +
    theme_tufte()

```
Passengers embarking at Southampton appear to over-represented among
the victims. The route of Titanic was
Southampton-Cherbourg-Queenstown. Was there a relation between the
port of embarkation and passenger class? Did more passengers in 3rd
class board at one or other of these ports? 


```{r}

ggplot() +
    geom_bar(data = training_relevant,
             aes(x = Embarked, y = ..count.., fill = Pclass), position = 'dodge') +
    theme_tufte()

```
That indeed appears to be the case! Then the port is essentially a
proxy for class.

# Prediction

Before we can go ahead and build a model, we need to do something
about the missing values, especially for the age variable.

## Handling missing values



```{r}
missing   <- filter(training, is.na(Age))
available <- filter(training, !is.na(Age))
```

Is there anything else in the data that could help us figure out age?
Perhaps a combination of the passenger class and fare paid?

```{r}

ggplot(available, aes(Fare, Age)) + geom_point() +
    facet_grid(Pclass~., scales = "free")  + geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
    theme_tufte()

```

That is not useful! Let us try with a combination of class and port.

```{r}
filter(available, !is.na(Embarked)) %>%
ggplot(aes(Fare, Age)) + geom_point() +
    facet_grid(Pclass~Embarked, scales = "free")  + geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
    theme_tufte()

```
That is marginally better. How about if we let of the class variable,
counter-intuitive as that may be.

```{r}
filter(available, !is.na(Embarked)) %>%
ggplot(aes(Fare, Age)) + geom_point() +
    facet_grid(Embarked~., scales = "free")  + geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
    theme_tufte()

```

Nope! That's no good. The reason is that the fare has been averaged
over each individual in a group. 

# Imputing missing data - Sampling from the estimated density kernel.


Since none of the variables are very helpful in informing the age of
the passenger, we will estimate the kernel of the distribution of the
age and draw samples from the estimated density to replace missing 
values.  See the answer [here](https://tinyurl.com/y9qtge2n).

```{r}
age_density <- density(training$Age, na.rm = TRUE)

age_na <- which(is.na(training$Age))
N <- length(age_na)
bw <- age_density$bw
age_nna <- filter(training, !is.na(Age)) %>% pull(Age)
means <- sample(age_nna, replace = TRUE)
training$Age[age_na] <- rnorm(N, mean = means, sd = bw)




```



## Multivariate regression

```{r}

model1 <- glm(formula = Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Age,
              family = binomial(link = "logit"), 
              data = training)

```

## Test 

Read in the test data and do prediction.
```{r}

test <- here::here("data", "test.csv") %>% read.csv

test$Pclass %<>% factor
test$Sex %<>% factor
test$Age %<>% as.numeric
test$Fare %<>% as.numeric
```
First, let us check as before if the test data set has any missing
values.

```{r}

apply(test, 2, function(col) sum(is.na(col)))

```
So one if the key variables Age, has a lot of missing values. Before
we fit our model to the test data, let us fill in the missing values
as before.

```{r}

age_density <- density(test$Age, na.rm = TRUE)

age_na <- which(is.na(test$Age))
N  <- length(age_na)
bw <- age_density$bw
age_nna <- filter(test, !is.na(Age)) %>% pull(Age)
means <- sample(age_nna, replace = TRUE)
test$Age[age_na] <- rnorm(N, mean = means, sd = bw)


```
And now, fit the model.

```{r}
fitted.results <- predict(model1, newdata = test,
                          type = 'response')

survived <- ifelse(fitted.results > 0.5,1,0)

submission <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId,
                         Survived = survived)

write.csv(submission, file = "submission.csv", row.names = F, quote = F)

```

This improves my submission over the previous entry where I just
inserted random 0s and 1s for missing values.
